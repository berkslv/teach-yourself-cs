<title>Teachpacks for How to Design Programs</title>
<body>

<p>
The Teachpacks distributed with older versions of DrScheme were
incompatible with the ones assumed by <a href="../index.htm">this book</a>.
These problems have been fixed in recent versions.
If you are using v103 of DrScheme or older, we strongly encourage you to
upgrade to v200 or newer.
