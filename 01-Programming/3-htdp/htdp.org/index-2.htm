This program has evolved and grown into the

project.

The past decade has seen significant changes in the design and
teaching of introductory computer science curricula.  Our TeachScheme! 
Project was at the vanguard of this change.  The result is in use at
hundreds of high schools and universities on nearly every continent.
Several companies not only use our software, they have even begun to
adopt our curriculum for in-house training.
</p>

<p>
As we discuss <a href="Overview/">in more depth</a>, we set out to
address fundamental problems that students face.  This has led to a
series of innovations in programming environments, programming
methodology, and programming languages.  But we focus not only on
creating new technology but equally on making these innovations
accessible to students; some of our material is now being successfully
used even in middle-schools.
</p>

<p>
One of our main offerings for educators is a free summer workshop
series.  This series has grown to encompass a transition to a
principled introduction to object-oriented programming in Java.  We
invite you to participate; if you are a US college faculty member, we
even have funding to cover your expenses.
</p>

<p>
Our Project comprises faculty and graduate students at several
universities including Adelphi, Brown, Cal Poly, Chicago,
Northeastern, Utah and WPI, with support from several other
universities as well as industrial organizations.  The Project is
primarily funded by the US National Science Foundation.
